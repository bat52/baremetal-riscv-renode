next:
I want to run multiple infinite loops at the same time
    need to increase smartness of scheduler
    needs a process state flag
I want monitor to have ability to suppress it's own prompt after launching so that other programs can use IO uninterupted
    Need a way for monitor to poll kernel for process statuses
Ability to launch multiple instance of program
    separate program from process
Persistance. e.g. storage peripherial and filesystem
design Simple FPGA-able matrix-multiply accelerator
    high level or verilog?
verilate the matmul, attach to renode
driver for matmul
Run everything on a real FPGA

Usage:

You can launch process via a single char.
Multiple process can be queued simply by putting multiple process ids
