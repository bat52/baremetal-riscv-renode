next:
Move from manual ecall to timer interrupt
implement the "schedule processes function"
    needs a process state flag
Ability to launch multiple instance of program
    separate program from process
Re-introduce multi-tasking
Persistance. e.g. storage peripherial and filesystem
design Simple FPGA-able matrix-multiply accelerator
    high level or verilog?
verilate the matmul, attach to renode
driver for matmul
Run everything on a real FPGA
