next:
bug - jumping to 0x0 for no reason once at startup, but only when timer IRQ is enabled
bug - process corrupts in race condition when multitasking (~1/8 times launching)
I want to stop a process and resume it.
    EOF can be sent via CTRL-D ('\004')
I want monitor to have ability to suppress it's own prompt after launching so that other programs can use IO uninterupted
    Need a way for monitor to poll kernel for process statuses
i want to know if a Process has blown stack
i want to know if we don't have room to allocate a new process
i want programs to be able to request sleep

Persistance. e.g. storage peripherial and filesystem
design Simple FPGA-able matrix-multiply accelerator
    high level or verilog?
verilate the matmul, attach to renode
driver for matmul
Run everything on a real FPGA

Usage:

You can launch process via a single char.
Multiple process can be queued simply by putting multiple process ids
